# Obsidian Cosensy Bridge
 
Cosensy Bridge is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that displays related links up to 2 hops away in a card format. This makes it easy to browse the connections between notes. Each card contains a preview of the corresponding note. This plugin is a fork of [2Hop Links Plus](https://github.com/L7Cy/obsidian-2hop-links-plus), but it's more similar to [Cosense](https://scrapbox.io/).
